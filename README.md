# Assignment 10 - Namedtuples

## Namedtuples are immutable like regular tuples. Once you store something in them you cannot modify it.

In named tuples, each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable) identifier. This frees you from having to remember integer indexes, or resorting to workarounds like defining integer constants as mnemonics for your indexe

### Q1. Dictionary approach:
This finds the following for different fake profiles and returns   
the most common bloodgroup,  
mean current location,  
oldest person age  
and the average age.  

This method is executed using Dictionary approach.

### Q2. Named Tuple approach:
Same as Q1 but this method is executed using namedtuple approach.

### Q3. Stock comparison:
Using namedtuple generates 100 companies from pyfake library and create a random dataset
The return value is - highest stock price on a day, open-stock price and close-stock price.

## Test cases
1) Checks if there is a README.md file
2) Checks if the README.md file has alteast 500 words
3) Checks if the required functions are present in the README.md file
4) Checks README.md file formatting
5) Checks if proper indentations are present throughout the python file
6) Checks if any one the functions have capital letters used in their names
7) Check namedtuple implementation of most common blood type
8) Check dictionary implementation of most common blood type
9) Check namedtuple implementation of mean location
10) Check dictionary implementation of mean location
11) Check namedtuple implementation of max age
12) Check dictionary implementation of max age
13) Check namedtuple implementation of avg age
14) Check dictionary implementation of avg age
15) Check if stock low is less than or equals to stock open, which is less than or equals to stock close which is less than or equals to stock high
