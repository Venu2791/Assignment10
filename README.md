# Assignment 10 - Namedtuples

## Namedtuples are immutable like regular tuples. Once you store something in them you cannot modify it.

In named tuples, each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable) identifier. This frees you from having to remember integer indexes, or resorting to workarounds like defining integer constants as mnemonics for your indexe

### Q1) Named Tuple approach:
This finds the following for different fake profiles and returns   
the most common bloodgroup,  
mean current location,  
oldest person age  
and the average age

This method is executed using Named tuple approach.

### Q2) Dictionary approach:
Same as Q1 but this method is executed using Dictionary approach.

### Q3) Stock comparison:
Using named tuple generates 100 companies from pyfake library and create a random dataset
The return value is - highest stock price on a day, open-stock price and close-stock price.

## Test cases
1) Checks if there is a README.md file
2) Checks if the README.md file has at least 300 words
3) Checks if the required functions are present in the README.md file
4) Checks README.md file formatting
5) Checks if proper indentations are present throughout the python file
6) Checks if any one the functions have capital letters used in their names
7) Check namedtuple implementation of all calculations
8) Check dictionary implementation of all calculations
9) Check named tuple vs dictionary. If named tuple is performing better than dictionary implementation
10) Check if stock low is less than or equals to stock open, which is less than or equals to stock close which is less than or equals to stock high
